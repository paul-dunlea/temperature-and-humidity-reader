	<h2>investigation and planning</h2>
		<p>in my own opinion, my investigation and planning was good, i planned out my objectives and i achieved each one, the making of my website and embedded system met the requirements and the advanced requirements in the coursework file, for my website i made sure that it met with each requirement, it required a user friendly navigation system and i made a navigation bar and everything is labelled, it required a clean, crisp, consistent visual design and i made the colours to mix well so the user can read and i made my webpage look professional, for the embedded system i made an automatic temperature and humidity reader, it has a data capture form on website as a graph, i implemented validation checks into my code, these features meet the needs of my users which i had planned for</p>
	<h2>design</h2>
		<p>in my own opinion, i did good on achieving my design ambitions and meeting my design requirements, in the design tab i went over the design of my artefact, it required me to have a clear description i did that by splitting my design ambitions into 4 diffent sections called design cycles, it required a diagram of the overall architecture system and i did that, all my design ambitions and design objectives were met</p>
	<h2>users</h2>
		<p>in my own opinion, the users that this artefact is intended for will be satisfied, they should be satisfied because my embedded system does as its told on the website and the features are intended to meet the need of my users, the only thing that users might not like is the user interface design which i mentioned in the design tab and because i was prototyping there might be a lot of bugs i didn't encounter in my testing, an unexpected result that i encountered in my code was testing for the csv file i got an output of the data but with uncessary symbols</p>
	<h2>future iterations</h2>
		<p>in my own opinion, my artefact has the potential of great improvement in the future, for the user interface design if the users don't like it they will give me feedback on it, i would add on adaptive and assistive technology like text to speech synthesizers to expand the target market to people who are blind, i would add on a feature that could control the temperature automatically </p>
