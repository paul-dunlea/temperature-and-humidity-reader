		<h1>Investigation and Planning (600 words)</h1>
		<hr>
		<br/>
		<p>After researching various ideas in using SMART technology, I decided on limiting my focus to three sensors.  THese sensors are designed to bring automation to households. THey are designed with all users in mind. As technology progressess, the gap between older users and young users is widening. Also, inflation and the cost of living is spiralling out of control and is incumbent on goevernments and companies to act responsibly in creating warm, comfortable homes for older and elderly users. </p>
	  <p>I have done a lot of desk research into this thematic brief, on the coursework 2022 pdf I visited all the links under the sub-header of further context, from that I got to know what a smart home or smart building was, I got examples of smart homes, also in the coursework 2022 pdf I researched for the requirements of the project, to see what was expected from me, I researched possible solutions in a smart home, for example CCTV, motion sensor light, smart lock, this helped me identify which type of system I wanted to make for my thematic brief, I made a decision on the solution and I researched for companies on google who were selling my chosen solution, I watched videos on YouTube reviewing the solution, they pointed out the flaws and pros for their product, I researched the target market for this product to get a perspective of the users</p>
	  <p>My chosen solution is a temperature and humidity reader, it will be used as a safety measure to read the temperature inside buildings, there will be an DHT11 sensor on it, and it detects the current temperature and humidity of the area which is in the vicinity of the sensor then displays them on the embedded system, it will also be used to gather information for example displaying the humidity and the temperature inside a fridge, my solution will have a inbuilt system on the website that will display the current temperature and display a live history graph of the fluctuations of the temperature and the humidity&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From my research I have identified that my end users will be chefs, elderly people and physicists who want an embedded system to display the temperature or humidity in an area, from this I have made my website user friendly meaning that if a customer buys it, they should not have trouble with navigating and reading through my website, my potential stakeholders will be people who are interested in my company and want to be a part of it, for the the objectives, my first objective will be making my website, my website will have a minimum of four separate pages, including a home page and a user-friendly navigation system. I will dedicate one of the pages to highlight the main issues addressed by my embedded system as well as its main features, my second objective will be making my embedded system, my embedded system will be when a home owner approaches wants to check the temperature, it will display it&nbsp;</p>
<h2>temperature sensor</h2>
		<p>THe use of temperature sensors is common with expensive climate controllers. These divide houses into different sections, reducing costs for families. However, not one company has looked at the bigger picture. We are warned about reducing costs, reducing or carbon footprint etc. I intend to build a prototype that will record temperatures in houses. Specifically to measure the coldest temperatures. With government grants to retrofit houses, they should be done on a humanitarian basis. If old houses, with older people are using more heat, or if people are in danger of living in conditions that are unhealthy adn cold, a record of temperature readings are collected and compared with other houses. Less energy costs and reduction of carbon fuels begins.</p>
	  <h2>New Builds</h2>
		<p>In order to watch future devolopers and building standards, temperature sensors should be installed in all houses to ensure they fit modern BER ratings. I intend to show that with minmal technology that home owners can have better control on heating expenses. </p>
		
		<h2>Sensors</h2>
		<p>The sensor I choose to work with is the inbuilt Microbit temperature sensor and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The DHT11 sensor is a five euros. My plan is to have multiple sensors sending signals to a microbit that will collect data. I then intend to use python and graphs to display the fluctuations in temperature and to find the mean and median results. This data can then used as source for refits, savings and new builds..</p>
