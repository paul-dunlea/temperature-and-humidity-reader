# temperature-and-humidity-reader
This was a 3 month project which I had to complete for my 2022 Leaving Certificate Computer Science coursework. With this project there is two folders artefact and report, the artefact folder contains a mock-up website, a program that displays a graph of sample temperature reading data from the device I made and then three other programs which gets the temperature reading data from the microbit, the report folder contains another website which explains everything about this project.
